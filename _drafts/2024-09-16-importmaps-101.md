title: Importmap with Ruby on Rails
---

About a month ago, I started a small pet project for my hobby, [downwind
foiling][1]. This website, uses charts to present all the collected data in a
graphical manner.

I used [Chart.js][2] to generate the charts. First I went with a gem called
[chartkick][3], but soon I had to abandon it because I could not get it working
with mixed chart types.

I needed access to all the features of the library and I no longer needed the gem that brought it into my project.

> With Rails 7 we have importmap. This approach to managing JavaScript in your
> applications was chosen for a couple of reasons. First ES6 is now supported by
> all browsers that matter. Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox. Secondly, HTTP/2 is
> now the norm meaning you can have a single connection that responds to the
> client with multiple small files. Now you can get rid of your bundler for
> JavaScript.

## What did I learn?

- `importmap-rails` is a DSL to generate an importmap JSON, but it is not feature complete.
- Importmap is a way to define logical routing and version pinning for ESM (ECMAScript Modules).
- It covers the majority of web application requirements
  - Look for a bundler compiler when dependencies are complex, or you need advanced bundling and transpiling features
  - Importmaps are supported by most modern browsers IE 11+ (there are shims).
- If a more complex solution is needed check out the [importmap-package-manager][4]

%% First things first. Briefly look over the importmap-rails gem README on
%% GitHub. This has A LOT of the information here plus more. Straight from the
%% horse’s mouth.
%%
%% Read David Heinemeier Hansson’s article on Modern web apps without JavaScript
%% bundling or transpiling. He describes the why and how of the importmap addition
%% to Rails 7.

%%
%% Appsignal produce a good Importmaps under the hood article that is well worth
%% a read to get a bit more information on what we covered above.
